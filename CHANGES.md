# Phase 2: Data Pipeline Development

## Data Producers Implementation
• User events producer with realistic e-commerce behavior simulation
• Transaction events producer with fraud detection and risk scoring
• IoT sensor producer with industrial monitoring and anomaly detection
• All producers with configurable throughput and realistic data patterns
• Session tracking, geographic distribution, and device simulation

## Flink Stream Processing Jobs
• User event aggregation job with tumbling windows and session analysis
• Elasticsearch sink job with multi-stream processing and data enrichment
• Real-time metrics calculation and windowed aggregations
• Event-time processing with watermarks and stateful operations
• Fault-tolerant checkpointing and exactly-once processing guarantees

## Stream Processing Features
• Complex event patterns with realistic fraud detection scenarios
• Time-series data with environmental sensor monitoring
• Risk categorization and anomaly detection algorithms
• Data enrichment with geographic and temporal metadata
• Session timeout detection and user behavior analysis

## Management and Automation Scripts
• Producer startup script with orchestrated service management
• Producer shutdown script with graceful termination
• Flink job build and deployment automation with Maven integration
• End-to-end pipeline testing with comprehensive validation
• Health checking and connectivity verification

## Data Pipeline Architecture
• Complete Kafka-Flink-Elasticsearch data flow implementation
• Multi-topic processing with proper partitioning strategies
• Stream joining and enrichment with reference data
• Real-time dashboard metrics and KPI calculation
• Error handling and data quality monitoring throughout pipeline
